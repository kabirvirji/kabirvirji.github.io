title: Tokyo Toilets
---

Tokyo Toilets is a toilet accessibility and education tool. It helps users find the closest public toilet available to them that suits their use-case. Data is generated via crowd-sourcing.  

This is a solution to a unique problem my social circle and I experienced while living/working in Tokyo.
