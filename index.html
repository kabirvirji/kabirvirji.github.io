        <!-- About -->
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello, hope you're doing well! My name is Kabir — welcome to my corner of the internet. I'm a software engineer currently based in Canada. Most recently, I was a backend engineer at <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/faire">Faire</a> in Toronto, working on the Marketplace Quality team tackling fraud and collaborating cross-functionally to improve our low-quality product listings.
            Before that, I was working as a software engineer in Tokyo and finishing my Computer Science degree at the University of Toronto.
            I've taken the last year to focus on my goals playing the competitive Pokémon Trading Card Game, which gave me the opportunity to travel the world and compete in tournaments at various levels.
            I am currently <strong>open</strong> to software engineering job opportunities.
        </p>

        <h3>Color Therapy</h3>
