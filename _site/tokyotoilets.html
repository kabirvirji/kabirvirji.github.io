<h1>Tokyo Toilets</h1>
<p>Tokyo Toilets is a toilet accessibility and education tool. It helps users find the closest public toilet available to them that suits their use-case. Data is generated via crowd-sourcing.</p>

<p>This is a unique problem I experienced while living in Tokyo, there exists many foreigners in Tokyo that struggle with using or finding toilets that suit their needs.</p>

<p><img src="assets/tt.gif" alt="fork" /></p>

<p>Some additional context is that there exists many convenience stores in Tokyo which have bathrooms available for public use, but are random in terms of the types of toilets and amenities they offer. It can be troubling to be in an unfamiliar place, trying to use a toilet that you don’t understand how to use, or trying to change your child’s diaper, only to find no changing stations in the bathrooms you are checking.</p>

<p>Tokyo Toilets solves this by pairing users to the toilets near to them that will allow them to get in and use the amenities as quickly as possible, while ensuring that the amenities that they need are available, as well as helping them understand how to use them once they arrive with diagrams, tutorials, and translations.</p>
