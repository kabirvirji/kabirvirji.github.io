## About me

<!-- _updated 09/10/2019_ -->

Hi, my name is Kabir and I'm a senior (4th year) computer science student at the [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/).
After taking a year off school to work in Tokyo, I'm now back in Canada to finish my undergraduate degree (remote from Vancouver).

During my year off I was a software engineering intern at 
Flagship, and before that at [Rakuten](https://www.rakuten.com). 
These opportunities excelled my growth both as a person and developer. Prior to these internships, I also interned at <a href="https://www.curvhealth.com/">Curv</a>, 
and <a href="https://lemonstand.com/">LemonStand</a> (acquired by <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>). 

I'm very interested in the intersection between technology and art, and my side projects reflect that. My most recent project is called 
[Color Therapy](https://www.colortherapy.io), which generates playlists using emotions and colors. You can read more about how it works 
  [here](https://github.com/kabirvirji/colortherapy/blob/master/README.md).
  

<p>Recently I've been spending my time working out of a co-working space - finishing up courses and grinding Leetcode. I'm graduating in April, and 
  currently applying to 
  newgrad 2021 software engineer positions all around the world.
